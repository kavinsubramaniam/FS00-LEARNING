    "\n",
    "- **ASGI**, or the Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface, is a Python standard that defines how web servers communicate with asynchronous Python web frameworks and applications. As the successor to the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface), ASGI enables non-blocking, real-time communication features like WebSockets and server-sent events, which were not supported by the synchronous WSGI standard. It provides a standardized interface for asynchronous servers and applications, allowing for high-throughput, real-time web applications with better performance and scalability in Python.\n",

    "- **Typing Hinting** using pydantic library. This increases the productivity of the programmers while coding. Typing Hinting is nothing but showing recommentions on methods and properties based on the data-type\n",

    "###  About UVICORN\n",
    "Steps inside Uvicorn:\n",
    "1. Create config → builds settings (host, port, app reference, logging).\n",
    "2. Initialize Server → sets up sockets, protocols, HTTP parsing (via h11 or httptools), and lifespan handlers.\n",
    "3. Bind to host/port → since you passed 0.0.0.0:8000, it opens a listening socket for connections on all interfaces.\n",
    "4. Start asyncio tasks → schedules the ASGI app (app) inside the loop, handling HTTP requests asynchronously.\n",
    "5. Event loop keeps running → but because of nest_asyncio, the notebook doesn’t crash — it keeps processing notebook commands too.\n",
